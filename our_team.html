        <h2>Khadja Erickson</h2>
        <h4>Executive Director, Tenant Resource Center Mid Michigan</h4>
        <img src="khadja_e.png" alt="Khadja Erickson" class="team-photo">

        <p>Khadja is a dedicated housing advocate, organizer, and Executive Director of the Tenant Resource Center Mid Michigan. With years of experience in harm reduction, eviction defense, and grassroots organizing, they have worked tirelessly to ensure Lansing tenants have the tools, knowledge, and support they need to stay housed and assert their rights.</p>

        <p>Collaboration has been at the heart of Khadjaâ€™s work. They have built strong relationships with legal aid organizations, social workers, mutual aid groups, city, county, and state officials to create tenant-focused solutions. Through their leadership, the TRC actively works with community partners to provide eviction defense, housing navigation, and policy advocacy that centers the needs of tenants.</p>

        <p>As the founder and director of The Hubris Collective, Khadja has led direct outreach efforts at encampment evictions, ensuring that displaced individuals receive critical support, resources, and advocacy. Their work extends beyond crisis response - Khadja is also working with the Ingham County Health Department to expand services for people living in encampments, helping to bridge the gap between public health resources and those most in need.</p>

        <p>Before leading the TRC, Khadja served as the Director of Mobile Distribution at Punks With Lunch Lansing, spearheading mobile harm reduction efforts to distribute safer use supplies deeper into the community. They also play a key role in tenant advocacy as the Housing Chair for the NAACP Lansing Chapter and as the inaugural Treasurer of Rent Is Too Damn High (still a current, button-wearing Tenant Union Member!), working to amplify tenant voices and push for stronger housing protections. Their role on the Eaton County Substance Use and Misuse Strategic Planning Committee fostered cross-sector partnerships to public health.</p>

        <p>Having experienced housing insecurity firsthand, Khadja understands the challenges tenants face and is deeply committed to building a future where safe, stable housing is a right - not a privilege.</p>
